She has a son who is autistic and a daughter who is somewhere on the spectrum but does not have a diagnosis. She has a passion for helping parents navigate the education system that is so desperately broken. Laura had a PGCert in SEN & Inclusion and a degree In teaching and Learning so has gained a lot of experience working with children with SEN. Laura is a Christian and has a clear vision for growing Revive so that more parents can access support."

              "Rev Jill Willett is a Baptist Minister, currently working as a prison Chaplain in HMP Leicester, where she encounters a number of adults who are on the autistic spectrum. She has two adult sons, who she fostered and then adopted. For four years this was as a single parent after she was widowed when the boys were 10 and 11yrs. Her youngest was 6 years old when they first met. He eventually got diagnosed with SEN and went to a Special School in Northumberland, then to Maplewell School when they moved to Leicestershire. Jill volunteered at the Northumberland school as a parent helper, and is well aware of how vital good support is for families. Her and her husband are Godparents to Lauraâ€™s children."
